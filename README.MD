## Naive lib for probability calculation
### Continuous distribution
The library provides ability to calculate the —Åontinuous probability by specifying 
the cumulative or density function in symbolic form or specifying density function in java native form.
Watch ContinuousDistribution and ContinuousDistributionFactory and tests in this package
ch.nn.probability.distribution.continuous.

Symbolic calculations restricted by SymJa lib symbolic integral calculation possibilities.

### Discrete distribution
The library provides ability to calculate some discrete distributions. Watch DiscreteDistribution implementations and examples in this package ch.nn.probability.distribution.discrete.
